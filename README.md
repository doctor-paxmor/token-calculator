## What It Does

MTG Token Calculator helps Commander players manage creature tokens during gameplay. Instead of using dice, counters, or paper to track your growing token armies, this calculator handles the math for you.

## Key Features

**Built-in Commanders**
- Pre-configured for 7 popular token commanders
- Each commander has specific token types and abilities already set up

**Token Multiplier System**  
- Automatic calculation with Doubling Season, Parallel Lives, and other token doublers
- Stack multiple multipliers and see the final count instantly
- Manual multiplier adjustments for unique scenarios

**Custom Content**
- Create custom commanders for any deck
- Add custom multipliers for any token-affecting card
- Import/export configurations to share with other players

**Game State Management**
- Tracks both untapped and tapped tokens separately
- Automatic saving - resume games exactly where you left off
- Each commander remembers its own token counts

## How It Works

1. Select your commander (or create a custom one)
2. Toggle on any token-doubling effects you have in play
3. Use the calculator to add/remove tokens as you play
4. The app handles all the multiplication math automatically
